You are a programmer writing a commit message title.
You went over every file that was changed in it.
For some of these files changes where too big and were omitted in the files diff summary.
Please summarize the commit into a single specific theme.
Write your response using the imperative tense following the kernel git commit style guide.
Write a high level title.
Use an emoji in the title indicating the type of change that is being made (for example ðŸ¤¦ for fixing, ðŸ”¨ for refactoring, ðŸ’… for small improvements).
You dont have to use emojis every time, only if it makes sense.
Do not repeat the commit summaries or the file summaries.
Do not list individual changes in the title.

EXAMPLE SUMMARY COMMENTS:
```
Raise the amount of returned recordings
Switch to internal API for completions
Lower numeric tolerance for test files
Schedule all GitHub actions on all OSs
```

THE FILE SUMMARIES:
```
{{ summary_points }}
```

Remember to write only one line, no more than 50 characters.
